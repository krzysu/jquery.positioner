# positioner.coffee
#### keep element in fixed position during window scroll

## How to use

positioner.coffee class is still in development, it works but has some bugs, so I will update this section when development is finished

## Test suite

You can test and improve positioner.coffee using my test suite. It contains of several Jasmine tests and test page where you can see it working live. Test suite is build on middleman app. It's easy:

-   clone this repository
-   run `bundle install`
-   run `middleman server`
-   go to `0.0.0.0:4567` in your browser for test/demo page
-   go to `0.0.0.0:4567/SpecRunner.html` to run Jasmine tests

## What about jquery plugin?

Will be soon, after finish of development, in fact this is only other form of initialization.
